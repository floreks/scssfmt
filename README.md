## Tidify

Fast and simple CSS formatter.

Tidify'd code is:

- easier to **write** : never worry about minor formatting concerns while hacking away.
- easier to **read** : when all code looks the same you need not mentally convert others' formatting style into something you can understand.
- easier to **maintain** : mechanical changes to the source don't cause unrelated changes to the file's formatting; diffs show only the real changes.
- **uncontroversial** : never have a debate about spacing or brace position ever again!

## Installation

via npm:

```
$ npm install tidify
```

via yarn:

```
$ yarn add --dev tidify
```
